1. **Android Studio** (latest version) - The primary IDE for developing and running Android applications.
2. **JDK (Java Development Kit)** - It's recommended to use the latest version.
3. **Gradle** - Integrated into Android Studio, but make sure synchronization works properly.
4. **Koneksi Internet** - Required to download project dependencies.
5. **Perangkat Android atau Emulator** - To run the application.

## How to Use

- Select "Open an Existing Project."
- Navigate to the extracted folder and select the main project folder.

### 3. Sync the Project
- Android Studio will automatically start Gradle synchronization.
- Ensure there are no errors during this process. If errors occur, check your internet connection or the `build.gradle` file.

### 4. Run the Application

## Important Notes
- **Synchronization Issues:**  If errors occur during Gradle synchronization, ensure you have a stable internet connection and a compatible Gradle version.
- **Minimum Android Version:** Perangkat target harus memenuhi persyaratan versi minimum yang ditentukan dalam file `build.gradle`.
- **Debugging:**  If the app fails to run, use "Logcat" to trace errors.
